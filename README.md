### TenPatch ###

This project is an alternative to libGDX's 9patch implementation. It aims to have the following features:

* Multiple stretch regions as seen with Android's implementation.
* An option for tiling stretch regions.
* Loading via skin JSON.
* An editor via Skin Composer

### How to Use ###

Add the following to your root build.gradle.

```
allprojects {
    ...
    repositories {
        ...
        maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
    }
}
```

Add the dependency to the core project.

```
project(":core") {
    apply plugin: "java"


    dependencies {
        ...
        compile 'com.github.raeleus:TenPatch:master-SNAPSHOT'
    }
}
```

Please see the examples in the [demo project](https://github.com/raeleus/TenPatch/tree/master/demo/src/com/ray3k/tenpatch/demo/desktop).
